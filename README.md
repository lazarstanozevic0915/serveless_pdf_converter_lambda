# Show Me the Code

This repo contains code used to run the [online demo](https://vladholubiev.com/serverless-libreoffice).

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compile.sh  <-- commands used to compile LibreOffice for Lambda
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra       <-- terraform config to deploy example Lambda
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iam.tf
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda.tf
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3.tf
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vars.tf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src         <-- example Lambda function node in Node.js used for website demo
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handler.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libreoffice.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logic.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json <-- put lo.tar.gz in this folder to deploy. Download it below
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ s3.js
```

Compiled and ready to use archive can be downloaded under [Releases section](https://github.com/vladgolubev/serverless-libreoffice/releases). Also check out [NPM package with bundled LibreOffice for Lambda (85 MB)](https://github.com/shelfio/aws-lambda-libreoffice).

# How to compile by yourself

> Check out a comprehensive [step-by-step tutorial](STEP_BY_STEP.md) from 0 to deployed function.

To run this, you will need to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

1. Install and configure Docker and docker-compose locally or on a `c5.2xlarge` spot instance with ~ 8 GB (the default) of storage attached.
1. In a terminal, run `docker-compose run --rm libreoffice`. It will compile LibreOffice and then copy layers.zip to your local drive.

# How To Help

## Reduce Cold Start Time

Currently ∆õ unpacks 109 MB .tar.gz to `/tmp` folder which takes ~1-2 seconds on cold start.

Would be nice to create a single compressed executable to save unpack time and increase portability.
I tried using [Ermine](http://www.magicermine.com/) packager and it works!!
But unfortunately this is commercial software.
Similar open-source analogue [Statifier](http://statifier.sourceforge.net/) produces broken binaries.

Maybe someone has another idea how to create a single executable from a folder full of shared objects.

**UPD:** TODO: Check out [node-packer](https://github.com/pmq20/node-packer) and [libsquash](https://github.com/pmq20/libsquash) (no FUSE required!)

## Further Size Reduction

I am not a Linux or C++ expert, so for sure I missed some easy "hacks"
to reduce size of compiled LibreOffice.

Mostly I just excluded from compilation as much unrelated stuff as possible.
And stripped symbols from shared objects.

Here is the list of: [available RPM packages](https://gist.github.com/vladgolubev/1dac4ed47a5febf110c668074c6b671c)
and [libraries](https://gist.github.com/vladgolubev/439559fc7597a4fb51eaa9e97b72f319)
available in AWS Lambda Environment, which can be helpful.

You can also use multi compression level, with upx and then decompress after brotli.

## Testing

Update repo for testing. Return before S3 for example, hardcode or generate files to convert and setup variables. Then simply run:

```
docker run \
 -v "\$PWD":/var/task \
 lambci/lambda:nodejs12.x src/handler.handler
```

After successful execution, get the resulted files to check the pdfs.

```
docker ps -a
```

Find exect container id.

Then execute

```
docker cp containerId:/tmp/filename.pdf ./filename.pdf
```

Then check your results locally
