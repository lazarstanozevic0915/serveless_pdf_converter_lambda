# How to compile by yourself

> Check out a comprehensive [step-by-step tutorial](STEP_BY_STEP.md) from 0 to deployed function. 

1. Go to [Lambda Execution Environment and Available Libraries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html) page to get the latest AMI id
2.  Click on [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Images:visibility=public-images;search=amzn-ami-hvm-2017.03.1.20170812-x86_64-gp2) to get AMI id for your region
3. Spin up a `c5.2xlarge` spot instance with ~ 100 GB of storage attached
4. Follow the steps in `compile.sh` file in the repo

# How To Help

## Reduce Cold Start Time

Currently ∆õ unpacks 109 MB .tar.gz to `/tmp` folder which takes ~1-2 seconds on cold start.

Would be nice to create a single compressed executable to save unpack time and increase portability.
I tried using [Ermine](http://www.magicermine.com/) packager and it works!!
But unfortunately this is commercial software.
Similar open-source analogue [Statifier](http://statifier.sourceforge.net/) produces broken binaries.

Maybe someone has another idea how to create a single executable from a folder full of shared objects.

**UPD:** TODO: Check out [node-packer](https://github.com/pmq20/node-packer) and [libsquash](https://github.com/pmq20/libsquash) (no FUSE required!)

## Further Size Reduction

I am not a Linux or C++ expert, so for sure I missed some easy "hacks"
to reduce size of compiled LibreOffice.

Mostly I just excluded from compilation as much unrelated stuff as possible.
And stripped symbols from shared objects.

Here is the list of: [available RPM packages](https://gist.github.com/vladgolubev/1dac4ed47a5febf110c668074c6b671c)
and [libraries](https://gist.github.com/vladgolubev/439559fc7597a4fb51eaa9e97b72f319)
available in AWS Lambda Environment, which can be helpful.
